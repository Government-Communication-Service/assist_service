Critical Assumptions\nIdentify the key assumptions that underpin each link in your logic chain:\nWhat must be true for activities to produce the expected outputs?\nWhat conditions are necessary for outputs to generate the desired outtakes?\nWhat factors will enable outtakes to translate into actual behaviour change?\nWhat broader conditions must exist for outcomes to contribute to the desired impact?\n\n4.

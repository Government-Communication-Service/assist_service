In times like ours, strengthening these foundations is ever more vital to the daily task of securing the national interest. But it is also vital so we can keep firmly on the course of change. Recent governments have veered violently from crisis to crisis, always vulnerable to the next fierce headwind. These foundations will allow the UK to maintain a powerful sense of direction through the storm.\n\nBuilding on these foundations, the Government has five national missions that set the direction of change. \n\nThese are:\n\n1 Kickstart economic growth\n2 Build an NHS fit for the future\n3 Safer streets\n4 Break down the barriers to opportunity\n5 Make Britain a clean energy superpower \n\nGuided by our missions, this Plan for Change shows the path to restoring that hope. But to drive us forward in this Parliament, we also need to set clear milestones to track our progress and allow the British people to hold us to account.  \n\nThese are:\n\n• raising living standards in every part of the United Kingdom, so working people have more money in their pocket as we aim to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7\n\n• rebuilding Britain with 1.5 million homes in England and fast-tracking planning decisions on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects\n\n• ending hospital backlogs to meet the NHS standard of 92% of patients in England waiting no longer than 18 weeks for elective treatment\n\n• putting police back on the beat with a named officer for every neighbourhood, and 13,000 additional officers, police community support officers (PCSOs) and special constables in neighbourhood roles in England and Wales\n\n• giving children the best start in life, with a record 75% of five-yearolds in England ready to learn when they start school\n\n• securing home-grown energy, protecting billpayers, and putting us on track to at least 95% clean power by 2030, while accelerating the UK to net zero\n",

        "content": "Our milestones for change can only be delivered on the foundations of a stable economy, secure borders and national security\n\nEconomic Stability:\nGrowing the economy to put more money in working people’s pockets, fix the NHS and rebuild Britain depends on economic stability.\nThis government is committed to the principles of sound money and economic responsibility.\nEconomic stability requires concerted action across 4 areas. First, we will deliver macroeconomic stability by boosting the UK’s resilience to shocks and supporting the independent Monetary Policy Committee as it acts to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably.\nSecond, we will provide financial stability by working with the Bank of England, financial sector regulators and international partners to ensure the resilience of the system that underpins our economy.\nThird, we will deliver fiscal stability through our robust fiscal rules, moving the current budget into balance so that day-to-day costs are met by revenues and reducing net financial debt (Public Sector Net Financial Liabilities) as a share of the economy.\nAnd fourth, we will deliver long term policy certainty, with a wider range of strategic measures including one major fiscal event a year, longer term capital budgets, a business tax roadmap, and multi-year local government settlements.\n\nSecure Borders:\nBritain is a tolerant and compassionate country, with a proud tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and abuse. But the system needs to be controlled and managed and we need strong borders.\nThe small boats crisis, fuelled by dangerous organised crime gangs, is undermining our security and costing lives. And the UK public need to be confident that the rules are respected and enforced and that the overall immigration system is under control.\nThe asylum system has been pushed into crisis, with backlogs reaching record levels and costs hitting £5.4 billion in the last financial year, up more than £1.4 billion on the year before.\nAt the same time net migration grew almost 5 times higher in the space of 4 years, driven by record levels of overseas recruitment.\nWe are acting to restore order to the asylum system, clearing the backlog, and ensuring that the rules are properly respected and enforced by increasing returns. Only by doing this, and working upstream to smash the gangs, will we reduce overall small boat crossings.\n\nNational Security:\nThe first duty of the government is to keep the country safe: national security underpins all our missions.\n\nThe threat to the UK is growing, driven by global instability, conflict, Russian aggression, the systemic challenge posed by China, climate change, rapid technological acceleration, and a greater willingness of states, terrorists, and criminals to act against our country and our allies.\n\nWe must make the country safer, more secure, and increasingly resilient against these interconnected threats. Working with our international partners, we will act to prevent harm; deter and disrupt threats; respond effectively to incidents; and recover swiftly.\n\nWe will work tirelessly to enhance the UK’s security, maintaining the transatlantic alliance and our unshakeable commitment to NATO, deepening cooperation with the EU, continuing our steadfast support to Ukraine for as long as is needed, and maintaining our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\nAt the same time, we will strengthen and modernise our armed forces, set out the path to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence in the spring and sustain our nuclear deterrent. We are restoring Britain’s global leadership on prevention and resolution of conflict, upholding the rules based international system and rule of law as well as the shift to secure energy through clean power, and tackling illegal migration.\n\nWe will strengthen our security at home, continuing to counter the enduring and evolving terrorism and state-based security threats, harnessing cutting edge technology and ensuring our intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies have the powers and capabilities they need.\n\nAnd we will drive secure growth and make the UK more resilient to the full range of risks, including climate change and those set out in the National Risk Register, such as cyber threats, food security, and disruption to critical supply chains.",

        "content": "Long term mission:\nEconomic growth is the number one mission of the government. Growth will fund our public services, enable investment in our hospitals and schools, and, most importantly, raise living standards for everyone.\n\nThrough our growth mission, this government will aim for the highest sustained growth in the G7 – with more people in good jobs, higher living standards, and productivity growth in every part of the United Kingdom.\n\nAs set out at the Autumn Budget 2024, through the 7 pillars of the growth mission, the government is restoring stability, increasing investment, and reforming the economy to drive up productivity, prosperity and living standards across the UK.\n\nGrowth can only be achieved in partnership with businesses, so we will develop and deliver these policies together.\n\nOur Milestone:\n\nThrough the growth mission, the government will deliver a milestone of higher living standards in every part of the United Kingdom by the end of the Parliament.\n\nWe will measure headline progress against this milestone through higher Real Household Disposable Income per person and GDP per capita by the end of the Parliament. We also believe that growth must be felt by everyone, everywhere, so we will track GDP per head at both a regional and national level to drive prosperity across the United Kingdom. We know that the main route to higher living standards is through good, productive jobs, stable employment, and a thriving business environment, and we believe that growth must be felt in every nation and region.\n\nHow will we achieve this milestone?\nWe cannot grow the economy and put more money in working people’s pockets without economic stability.\n\nThrough the Budget, the government has delivered on the first step of restoring economic stability, with tough decisions, strict spending rules and robust institutions.\n\nTo deliver an economy that is growing, creating wealth and opportunity for all, our next steps will:\n\nDeliver growth by working in partnership with businesses. We will bring businesses right to the heart of our growth mission, building on the UK’s unique sectoral opportunities and creating the right conditions for investment through our 10-year Industrial Strategy.\n\nThe government is creating the right environment for business investment, having already established the National Wealth Fund to catalyse over £70 billion of private investment.\n\nAnd we will reform and expand the Office for Investment, improving government’s ability to land transformational investments by originating deals, clearing barriers and working with local leaders to develop investable propositions.\n\nEnsure every nation and region realises its full potential. We are working with the devolved governments and partnering with our mayors to develop local growth plans, giving them the tools they need in areas like adult education, skills and employment support.\n\nWe will invest in our great city regions to drive productivity and connect more people to the opportunities they afford. Our work with the devolved governments is part of our wider reset of relationships to support growth across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nDrive innovation, investment and the adoption of technology to seize the opportunities of a future economy, from AI to net zero. We will capitalise on the UK’s excellence in science and innovation to ensure our world-class research translates to commercial success.\n\nTo promote innovation and harness the full potential of the UK’s science base, we are protecting record funding for research and development.\n\nAnd our AI Opportunities Action Plan will set out how we will capture the benefits of the fourth industrial revolution which Artificial Intelligence is delivering.\n\nHelp people get a job, stay in work, and progress in their careers, with good employment opportunities across the country. We will train the workforce we need – both for now and the industries of the future – through the newly established Skills England and the Industrial Strategy Council, along with a reformed jobs and career service.\n\nWe will support the lowest paid workers with job security and improved working conditions through our Plan to Make Work Pay. The government will help more people to seize the opportunities of employment, helping them overcome the challenges of ill-health related inactivity and other barriers to work through the actions set out in the Get Britain Working White Paper.\n\nWe will continue to provide security in retirement by maintaining the State Pension Triple Lock for the duration of this Parliament, and we will always support those who cannot support themselves; but those who can work, must work.",

        "name": "Kickstarting Economic Growth: Rebuilding Britain",
        "content": "Rebuilding Britain:\n\nHome ownership has become a distant dream for too many working people. The failure over the last 14 years to build the homes the country needs has led to a housing crisis.\n\nIncreasing numbers of people have been unable to buy a home of their own; since 1990, homeownership for 19 to 29-year-olds has more than halved. Last year, homebuilding was falling.\n\nThe number of homes granted planning permission also fell to the lowest for a decade. These trends have led to the average home costing 8 times the annual earnings of an average worker.\n\nThe impacts are felt by renters, too, with private sector tenants spending an average of one-third of their income on housing costs.\n\nAt the sharpest end of the housing crisis is a shortage of social housing that has left over 150,000 children, the highest on record, in temporary accommodation, and rough sleeping 27% higher than last year.\n\nBritain also lacks other key infrastructure that we should be able to rely on such as transport and energy, or gigafactories and data centres needed for industries of the future.\n\nIt is slower and more costly to build economic infrastructure in England than other major countries like France and Italy. No new reservoir has been built since 1992.\n\nThe time it takes to secure planning permission for major economic infrastructure projects has almost doubled in the last decade to more than 4 years. Our growth mission will change this: fast-tracking infrastructure delivery and home building and enabling businesses to invest.\n\nOur Long term mission:\n\nThe sheer scale of the housing crisis demands a radical response. Through the growth mission, we will rebuild Britain, delivering new homes and the critical infrastructure that underpins economic growth – with investment today driving future productivity growth and higher living standards.\n\nAffordability of housing has fallen drastically as too few houses have been built, particularly in major cities. The government will deliver housing of every tenure in the right places, supporting our towns and cities to grow, and providing the homes people want near to businesses and employment opportunities.\n\nWe will make it easier to build vital infrastructure such as roads, railways, broadband connections and laboratories needed for a modern economy to thrive.\n\nOur milestone\nWe must make the dream of home ownership a reality for people across the country. New homes must be supported with the right infrastructure, from roads to reservoirs. So, through the growth mission, the government has a hugely ambitious milestone of building 1.5 million safe and decent homes in England this Parliament.\n\nA boost in new homes must deliver for aspiring owners and renters, and provide secure, affordable and quality housing.\n\nWe will do this while delivering the infrastructure the country needs – not simply through investment, but by reforming planning rules and fast-tracking 150 planning decisions on major infrastructure by the end of this Parliament – more than double the number decided in the previous Parliament.\n\nIn building 1.5 million homes, we will measure progress through the number of net additional dwellings built in England over the course of this Parliament.\n\nHow will we achieve this milestone?\nThis is an ambitious milestone for change. It will require a rate of housebuilding and infrastructure construction not seen in over 50 years. In all these areas, we are taking swift action – but it will take time before that translates into delivery.\n\nLead times in planning, infrastructure and construction mean we are already constrained by the decisions we have inherited, but we expect the number of new homes to start rising significantly in the third year of the Parliament once our reforms take effect.\n\nThis means we must do things differently. We must deliver a step change in investment, radically reform the planning system and provide long-term policy certainty.\n\nThat is why we will publish ten-year strategies for housing and infrastructure next spring, with clear priorities, plans to deliver, and a pipeline of projects for investors and supply chains. These will reflect our next steps – reform, investment, supply. We will:\n\nReform the planning system so that it is pro-growth and pro-infrastructure. We will publish a new National Planning Policy Framework by the end of 2024 and update all relevant National Policy Statements by next summer. We will make improvements to planning at a local level, modernising planning committees and increasing local planning capacity.\n\nWe will use the Planning and Infrastructure Bill to create a win-win for development and nature; and streamline processes for critical infrastructure.\n\nFor the first time we will strategically join up decisions on housing, business growth and infrastructure at both a national and local level, with the Westminster government’s industrial, housing and infrastructure strategies aligning with the local growth plans and strategic development plans led by mayors. Only by delivering these reforms will we unlock investment and delivery.\n\nWork in partnership with local leaders, housebuilders and infrastructure developers to deliver investment into these sectors and diversify the housebuilding system so that it has the necessary range of providers, business models, workforce, technology, and innovation to deliver 1.5 million new homes.\n\nWe will also begin building the next generation of new towns, including delivering major urban extensions and unblocking development where it has stalled. To do this we will work with training providers, industry and local government to expand the building workforce with the right skills, fit for the future.\n\nOur housebuilding drive will present significant opportunities throughout the supply chain for businesses of all sizes, while our infrastructure reforms will underpin greater business and investor confidence.\n\nIncrease supply and deliver the biggest boost to social and affordable housing in a generation, ensuring the benefits of housebuilding are felt by those on lower incomes. As set out at the Budget, we are injecting an additional £500 million in the Affordable Homes Programme, taking its annual budget to £3.1 billion next year.\n\nWe are also providing the sector with long-term rent certainty with the ambition to grow the number of new social rent homes at a consistent rate.\n\nPutting affordable housing at the heart of our plan to deliver 1.5 million homes will ensure that homes go to people who need them, as well as helping to reduce record homelessness levels.\n\nThese actions will help us to deliver the biggest boost to new social and affordable homes for a generation.",

        "name": "An NHS Fit for the Future",
        "content": "The starting point: \n\nFor decades, the NHS has served us well, with the enduring principle that everyone should get healthcare that is free at the point of use.\n\nYet, independent investigation into the NHS found the health service is in “critical condition”.\n\nThe investigation laid bare the challenges the NHS and the nation’s health are facing. But it has also made it absolutely clear that total, fundamental and long-term reform of our NHS is critical to its survival: a total reimagining of the NHS.\n\nThe investigation found the NHS is failing to deliver on one of its most important promises: timely access to care.\n\nIn England, the waiting list for elective treatment stood at 7.6 million in September 2024, with more than 3 million waiting over 18 weeks, people are waiting too long to get the GP or NHS dentist appointments they need, and 10% of patients are now waiting for 12 hours or more in A&E.\n\nLong waits have become routine and public satisfaction is, understandably, at a record low as a result. But the pressures facing the NHS are symptomatic of a wider set of issues. As the investigation found, there has been a deterioration in the nation’s health.\n\nPeople are spending more of their lives in ill-health and the gap in healthy life expectancy between the poorest and richest is growing.\n\nThis is not just bad for those people, but is a drag anchor on the wider economy. There are 2.8 million people out of work due to health conditions, creating a cycle of poor health and poverty for many, holding back opportunities and economic growth.\n\nThe long-term survival of the health service depends on both investment and, more importantly, reform.\n\nThe Budget started to address these problems, with a nearly £26 billion boost for the healthcare system, across day-to-day spending and capital investment, over 2 years. But investment alone is not the solution – investment must come with reform. That is what the health mission will deliver – fundamental reforms to improve the way care is provided: improving people’s health and putting the NHS on a more sustainable footing.\n\nWe will capitalise on the scientific and technological revolution happening all around us to deliver better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers’ money.\n\nOur long-term mission\nOur mission to build an NHS fit for the future starts with tackling waiting lists. We will make progress towards returning to NHS performance standards and improve access to services. We want to see fewer lives being lost to the biggest killers, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke, and suicide.\n\nThis means diagnosing and treating patients earlier and enabling people to better manage their health and care.\n\nPeople deserve to live in a fairer Britain, where everyone lives well for longer. A healthy society and functioning health system should also ensure people can live their life to the fullest without major health issues holding them back.\n\nBy addressing the main underlying drivers of ill-health and tackling persistent inequalities in health, we will put the NHS on a sustainable footing for the future.\n\nDelivering the mission requires 3 big reform shifts, which will be central to the government’s 10 Year Health Plan, to be published in spring 2025.\n\nThese are fundamental and necessary reforms in the way our health services deliver care and address the very challenges that Lord Darzi identified in his report. First, from ‘hospital to community’, bringing care closer to where people live, including through a new neighbourhood health service to deliver more proactive and personalised care.\n\nSecond, from ‘analogue to digital’, by rolling out new technologies and digital approaches to modernise the NHS, including bringing together a single patient record, owned by the patient, shared across their care teams, putting people in control of their own health.\n\nAnd third, from ‘sickness to prevention’, shortening the amount of time people spend in ill-health by preventing illnesses before they happen, as well as earlier identification and management of chronic conditions.\n\nWe will work in partnership with the public, clinicians and experts as part of the biggest national conversation about the future of the NHS since its birth so that the 10 Year Health Plan pulls on the ideas and expertise of patients, staff and the wider public.\n\nOur milestone\nPeople should have access to health and care when they need it. We cannot be successful in our health mission without getting the NHS back on its feet and bringing waiting lists under control.\n\nThis Parliament, our health milestone is to end hospital backlogs by delivering our ambitious milestone of meeting the NHS standard that 92% of patients should wait no longer than 18 weeks from referral to start consultant-led treatment of non-urgent health conditions.\n\nHow will we achieve this milestone?\nAs promised in the manifesto, the government’s immediate priority has been to get a grip on record waiting lists.\n\nTo put us on track to reducing waiting times for elective care, the 2024 Autumn Budget provided funding to support the NHS to deliver the first step of an extra 2 million NHS operations, scans, and appointments a year in England, equivalent to 40,000 additional appointments a week.\n\nOur milestone for change is ambitious, requiring a significant reduction in waiting list times with challenging public finances. For this reason, investment alone is not the answer: we will only deliver our milestone by reforming elective care. Working with the NHS, our next steps will:\n\nTransform how elective care is delivered, improving productivity, and the way in which patients receive care, including more direct and timely diagnostic test referrals and results, increasing the availability of testing in communities and neighbourhoods. The capital investment provided in Autumn Budget 2024 will fund new surgical hubs and diagnostic scanners to build capacity.\nTransform patients’ experience of care, by embracing technology. Care will be centred around patients’ lives and choices, as opposed to being inflexible and outdated. We will transform the NHS app, giving users the information they need to navigate and take control over their care.\nTransform the model of care to make it more sustainable. There will be an increased focus on prevention throughout a patient’s care journey, dealing with issues earlier when they are easier to treat or cure. Siloed models of care will be reformed to improve patient experience and outcomes.\n\nReferral processes will be effective and informed, with GPs having easier access to specialist clinical advice, and the priority will be to provide the right care, in the right place, at the right time, which may not be in a hospital settings",

Community policing has been diminished, with neighbourhood officers pulled off the beat to plug shortages elsewhere, weakening connections with communities they serve.\n\nSince 2010, the proportion of people who see a police foot patrol more than once per week has more than halved, and the number of Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) has halved.Trust in the police has been undermined by cases of appalling misconduct and criminality by some officers. Powers to combat antisocial behaviour and shoplifting have been weakened, leaving our town centres exposed.\n\nBusinesses in our high streets need crime down too. Our justice system has been allowed to grind to a halt. Meanwhile, violent crime is too high: with over 50,000 instances of knife crime in the year to June 2024.\n\nViolence Against Women and Girls continues to plague society, with 1.1 million people experiencing sexual assault in the past 12 months, 2.2 million people experiencing domestic abuse, and 1.5 million people experiencing stalking. Working with the police, we will turn this around.\n\nOur long-term mission\nThe safer streets mission aims to reduce serious harm and increase public confidence in policing and in the criminal justice system.\n\nIntegral to the safer streets mission is our ambition to halve knife crime and halve Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) within a decade.\n\nWe are already taking determined action to overhaul the policing response to domestic abuse and introducing stronger measures to tackle stalking and spiking.\n\nOn knife crime, we are banning lethal weapons and working to ensure dangerous blades do not end up in the wrong hands. However, we know that reliable and effective local policing is the bedrock for the safer streets mission to succeed.\n\nThat is why we will deliver the Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee and put 13,000 additional police officers, PCSOs and special constables into neighbourhood policing roles. This will ensure that the police are visible in every community, deterring and preventing crime as well as responding to emergencies.\n\n\nWe cannot achieve this mission through further investment alone. We cannot spend our way to improved policing and safer neighbourhoods.

Anti-social behaviour is a blight on local areas and, if left unchecked, we know it can escalate into more serious offending.\n\nThe presence of neighbourhood officers will deter and drive down incidents of anti-social behaviour, and these officers will be equipped with the power to issue Respect Orders to ban persistent offenders from town centres.\n\nOver the course of this Parliament we will transform neighbourhood policing. The Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee will ensure:\n\nPolice back on the beat. A neighbourhood policing team in every local area, carrying out intelligence-led and visible patrols, including in town centres and on high streets. We will hold forces to account for ensuring neighbourhood policing teams are protected, so they remain focused on serving communities.\nCommunity led policing. A named, contactable officer for every neighbourhood, responsive to local problems. Residents and local businesses will be able to have their say on the police’s priorities for their area.\nClear performance standards and professional excellence. We will establish a new Police and Crime Performance Unit in the Home Office – which will use high-quality data to spot trends, and drive-up performance standards, ending the current inconsistency across 43 force areas.\nThis new unit will agree a single performance framework for policing, including minimum standards on neighbourhood policing, providing an important source of accountability for communities.\nA new neighbourhood policing career pathway. New training for officers and standards for professional excellence will ensure neighbourhood policing is developed as a specialist policing capability.\nA crackdown on anti-social behaviour. Neighbourhood policing teams will have tougher powers, and supported by other agencies, tackle persistent anti-social behaviour.\nThis includes piloting the new Respect Order to enable swift enforcement against prolific offenders, and a dedicated lead officer in every force working with communities to develop a local anti-social behaviour action plan.\nSafer town centres.

        "content": "The starting point\nWhoever you are, wherever you come from, ours should be a country where hard work means you can get on in life.\n\nBut the reality for many children today is that opportunity is too often limited, and their background can have a decisive impact on the life they are able to build.\n\nChildren’s early years are crucial to their development, health and life chances. Antenatal classes, health visitors, parenting support, baby and toddler groups and access to affordable, high quality early education and childcare – all are vital to guiding parents and supporting child development.Yet over 80% of parents have said they struggled to access services. Childcare is too often unaffordable, or not available at all. This lack of support contributes to too many children not being ready to start school, with over a third of children unable to dress independently and 90% of reception teachers saying they have at least one child in the class not toilet trained.\n\nThe impact of this is felt by all children in the classroom, with around 2.5 hours of teacher time lost daily, impacting the education of the whole class.\n\nOnce at school, gaps persist and widen, with too many children going on to leave school without essential qualifications and skills. Worse, the government has inherited an attendance crisis with one in 5 children now missing a day a fortnight of school or more.\n\nThis holds young people back from progressing to college, apprenticeships or university and ultimately into good employment, depriving businesses of the skilled workers they need.\n\nOur long-term mission\nThe opportunity mission will break the link between a child’s background and their future success, delivering across 4 key areas:\n\nSet every child up for the best start in life. This means delivering accessible, integrated maternity, baby and family support services through the first 1,001 days of life; and high-quality early education and childcare to set every child up for success.\nHelp every child to achieve and thrive at school, through excellent teaching and high standards. This will include a focus on disadvantaged children and those with special educational needs and disabilities.\n\nImpact will be measured through attainment at the end of secondary school. The mission will also tackle the generational challenge of school absence, including by bolstering young people’s sense of belonging.\n\nBuild skills for opportunity and growth so that every young person can follow the pathway that is right for them. Whether through high-quality apprenticeships, colleges or universities, skills give people the power to seize opportunity.\n\nWe will measure progress through the proportion of young people in education or employment with training, and through the number achieving higher level qualifications.\n\nUnderpinning all of these, build family security – ensuring every child has a safe loving home, and tackling the barriers that mean too many families struggle to afford the essentials.\n\nCritically this means tackling the scar of child poverty, which limits opportunities and holds back life chances.\n\nOur milestones\nAll children should be starting primary school ready to learn. Yet, since the pandemic, we have seen more children starting primary schools without basic development.\n\nThat means teachers cannot focus on teaching, impacting all children in the class. Ensuring children have the best start in life is the foundation of the opportunity mission. To achieve our overall mission objective of closing the opportunity gap, we have set a milestone of a record proportion of children starting school ready to learn.\n\nWe will measure our progress through 75% of 5-year-olds reaching a good level of development in the Early Years Foundation Stage assessment – which looks at children’s development across areas like language, personal, social and emotional development, and maths and literacy – by 2028.\n\nThis is an increase from 67.7% currently, and would mean an additional 40,000 to 45,000 children a year hitting developmental goals.\n\nHow will we achieve this milestone?\nOur first step for the opportunity mission is recruiting 6,500 extra teachers, focussing on subjects with shortages and areas with the biggest recruitment challenges. This will be critical to children’s success in school. But to access excellent teaching, and free teachers to teach the whole class, children must start school ready to learn.\n\nDelivering our next steps in giving children the best start in life will require accessible, integrated baby and early childhood services to build the foundations for future success.\n\nWe will:\n\nRoll out government-funded childcare support to improve access, delivering the expansion to 30 funded hours and supporting 3,000 new and expanded school-based nurseries, increasing the availability of high-quality childcare places where they are needed most.\nWork in partnership with the sector, reforming training and support for the workforce to drive up standards. Only by listening to the expertise and experiences of those on the ground can we deliver this together.\n\nWe will work towards a stronger early years system, beginning with offering sustained professional development and working with providers to help spread evidence-based programmes as part of comprehensive plans to drive high-quality early education and care.\n\nWe will ensure that the Reception year sets children up for success in the rest of primary school, by rolling out schools’ access to evidence-based programmes that boost early literacy and numeracy skills.\n\nStrengthen and join up family services to improve support through pregnancy and early childhood.\n\nThis includes continuing to invest in and build up Family Hubs and Start for Life programmes to support early child health, parenting and home learning programmes, and strengthening health visiting services for all families, and improved early identification of special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).",

        "name": "Make Britain a Clean Energy Superpower",
        "content": "The starting point\nEvery family and business has paid the price of rocketing energy bills.\n\nBy failing to invest at scale over many years in the clean, secure home-grown power that our country needs, we have been left exposed to volatile international fossil fuel markets.\n\nThis failure was starkly exposed when Putin invaded Ukraine and British energy customers were amongst the hardest hit in Europe, with bills hitting a record high. As long as Britain remains exposed to these markets, families will be vulnerable to these price spikes.\n\nAt the same time, we have seen other countries steal a march in the race to secure the clean energy jobs and industries of the future. And all the while, the climate crisis is growing more urgent, with spiralling impacts that threaten our children’s futures.\n\nThe UK is home to abundant natural resources for renewable energy, and a pioneering industry delivering the latest advancements in clean tech.\n\nOur clean energy mission will harness these opportunities to deliver change, and the opportunity for growth and good jobs in clean tech.\n\nOur long-term mission\nThe British people deserve lower cost, clean, secure power, with good jobs, and a government that protects us from the long-term threats we face.\n\nThe economic case, the national security case and the environmental case all now point in the same direction: a clean energy mission which protects the country from exposure to unstable international markets and gives security and stability to both family and national finances.\n\nWe will achieve this through delivering clean power by 2030 and accelerating to net zero. Our mission will bring energy security, protect billpayers, create good jobs, and help to protect future generations from the cost of climate breakdown.\n\nBy building a diverse low carbon energy system, we will make the most of our abundant natural resources to keep bills down for good and protect consumers from future price shocks.\n\nIn doing so, we can revive the strength of British manufacturing, bringing jobs and investment into Britain’s industrial heartlands – unleashing the power of British technological innovation, and crowding tens of billions of private investment into our country.\n\nWe will accelerate to net zero across the economy, seizing one of the economic opportunities of the 21st century – creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs and driving investment into all parts of the UK, while protecting the planet for our children.\n\nOur legally-binding carbon budgets are a key metric for the government, which we will use to measure progress in our mission to accelerate to net zero, reducing our territorial emissions.\n\nThe government’s approach to this transition is built on the principle of fairness – for consumers by ensuring energy security and protecting billpayers, and for workers by ensuring decarbonisation is a route to reindustrialisation.\n\nRather than letting other countries win the race for new jobs and the industries of the future, we will ensure that we make, build, and buy more in Britain again, backing our homegrown technology pioneers and British workers. Great British Energy will be 100% owned by the British people, for the British people.\n\nOur milestone\nEnergy security, protecting billpayers, good jobs and climate security – that is what our clean energy mission will deliver.\n\nAs we make Britain a clean energy superpower and accelerate to net zero, we will see the benefits this Parliament through protecting billpayers from gas price spikes and creating jobs across the country.\n\nBuilding a diverse energy sector based on renewables and nuclear will revive British manufacturing and innovation, bringing much needed investment and good jobs to our industrial heartlands and helping to drive growth across all parts of the UK.\n\nThe government’s milestone this Parliament is to secure our energy supply with home-grown, clean power.\n\nWe will measure this by being on track to achieving at least 95% of low carbon generation by 2030 in line with advice from the National Energy System Operator (NESO).\n\nBy doing this, we will secure our energy supply, protect billpayers, and unlock tens of billions of private investment across the country. This milestone is ambitious, requiring significant acceleration of building renewable energy and the transmission network, and of electricity storage deployment.\n\nHow will we achieve this milestone?\nWe are already delivering on our first step by setting up Great British Energy in Aberdeen, a publicly owned company which will drive clean power generation, increasing energy security, boosting jobs, and ensuring UK taxpayers, billpayers and communities reap the benefits of the clean energy transition.\n\nIt is time for the British people to own and build things again.\n\nSince July 2024, the government has lifted the ban on onshore wind, consented more solar power than over the last 14 years and held a record-breaking renewables auction. We have also set up Clean Power 2030, led by Chris Stark, to drive though our clean power agenda, breaking down barriers and accelerating progress on energy projects.\n\nThe forthcoming Clean Power 2030 Action Plan will set out the further steps we will take, including reforming the planning system and building the grid. In delivering our next steps, we will do things differently. We will:\n\nEnsure the economic benefits of clean energy and net zero are felt by workers and billpayers across the country. We know that the clean energy transition is one of the economic opportunities of the 21st century, protecting consumers from future price shocks, creating new and innovative businesses, and bringing good jobs to workers.\n\nAlongside delivery of clean power, we are investing to improve energy efficiency in British homes and workplaces, delivering on our Warm Homes Plan, to cut bills for good – including through targeted measures for lower-income households to slash fuel poverty.\n\nWork in partnership with businesses and the sector and provide long-term certainty, with catalytic public investment. We will crowd in business investment through Great British Energy and the National Wealth Fund, and we will remove barriers in the planning process and grid to help enable clean power by 2030.\nPower up infrastructure across the country. If we want cheaper electricity, we need new pylons, wind farms and infrastructure. That is why we have lifted the ban on onshore wind, and we will reform and speed up our planning system to deliver the investment we need for clean power.\nHarness cutting-edge technology as we build out clean power. The UK is home to some world-leading green-tech companies and researchers, pioneering the way to a clean future. Our recent funding commitment of £21.7 billion for carbon capture cements Britain as one of the most advanced CCUS markets globally and paves the way for innovation in the supply chain. With an industry target for at least 50% of the supply chain to be UK-based, there will be significant opportunities to export UK technology abroad in a global sector that is expected to attract £135 billion investment by 2035.\nEnsure the public enjoy the full benefits of home-grown clean power, as the UK accelerates to net zero. Already, we are taking action to support households and businesses towards using cheap, clean power: in their cars and vans including through our investment in electric charging to support a 2030 phaseout, in their heating systems through our Warm Homes Plan, and in industrial processes and elsewhere across the economy. Only by helping everyone benefit from clean power can we deliver jobs, growth, energy security and tackle the climate crisis.",
